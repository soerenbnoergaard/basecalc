# Basecalc

It does the following:
- Converts bin -> hex, adding zeros if needed.
- Converts hex -> bin.

This is how it works: When the program launches, you input your number, preceding a character to indicate the base of the number you are inputing. Example:

## BIN -> HEX:
    b10110100
    B4

## HEX -> BIN:
    hA4
    1010 0100

## Quit
    q

## Install and uninstall
    sudo make install
    sudo make uninstall

Basically copies the binary file to `/usr/local/bin`.
